# Satellite_SquallLine

## Abstract
In this study, the brightness temperature was used to define the relevant sub-regions of the squall line, and the composition of its cloud regimes and traditional cloud types was analyzed and discussed. It can be known that in the squall line region, as to weather states (WSs), WS1 is dominated; in terms of cloud types, deep convective clouds are dominated. Moreover, in the rear and front regions, it can be seen that the proportion of deep convection in the rear region is higher than the proportion of suppressed convection; on the contrary, in the front region, the proportion of the latter is higher; these may relate to the clouds dynamical processes and some weather systems accompanied, e.g., the supercells and the surface fronts.
